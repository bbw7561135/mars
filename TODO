Code Infrastructure
-------------------

Implement the non regular grid:
    - this requires rewriting the Grid object so that dx, dy, dz are arrays
    and that vertices are arrays, this will also mean rewriting the output function.

To Do list for project:

- choose type of output via user parameters.

- make io class.

- do comparison to cython.

- Restart files.


Extra Physics
-------------
[ ] Self-gravity.

[ ] MHD
