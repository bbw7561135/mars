  This Code is in tended to be used by the Astrophysics 
  community as a tool to investigate hydrodynamics and 
  magnetihydrodynamics on a stellar scale. That is to 
  say, that this code is a responce to the many 
  astrohysics fluid codes in the community which are 
  written from the point of view of cosmology reseach.

  While this area is an extreamly important (said to 
  prevent my partner from killing me). Stellar scale 
  astrophysics is
